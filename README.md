# NN_Physics
A collection of lectures and scripts on Machine Learning and Neural Networks applied to the solution of quantum many body systems, such as finding its ground states, excited states, time evolution and diagram phase.

Every code found in this repository is written on Python, only using NumPy, JAX and PyPlot.

This scripts can be viewed as tutorial on how to use JAX for fast sampling, and how to use Neural Network models for solving quantum many-body problems, along with numerical methods such as variational principle and optimization methods.
